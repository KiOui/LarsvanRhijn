## 👋 About Me

I’m the **Lead Developer at [Montsecure](https://montsecure.com/)**, working on making **5G networks safer** through automated security testing.  
Our software simulates attacks on 5G core network functions to detect vulnerabilities and supports network certification under the **BSI NESAS** scheme.

My work involves:
- Expanding and improving security testing software.
- Researching and developing new **3GPP SCAS tests**.
- Implementing advanced attack simulations for network validation.

Outside of work, I enjoy:
- **Fitness & Kickboxing** — Deadlifts are my favorite lift.
- **Music** — Mixing tracks with my DJ controller and lighting setup (powered by [QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org)).
